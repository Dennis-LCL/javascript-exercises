# JavaScript Exercises

## Instructions

Each folder has it's own README file. Follow the instructions contained therein.

Each folder contains an `index.js` file which is the default file that Node.js will try to run. This means that to run `inheritance/index.js`, you could do

```sh
node inheritance
```

which is the same as running

```sh
node inheritance/index.js
```
